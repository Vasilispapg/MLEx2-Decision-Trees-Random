## Overview
This repository contains a series of exercises completed as part of an ML Class. The exercises cover various machine learning techniques, including Logistic Regression, Instance-Based Learning, Random Forests, and more. Each exercise demonstrates the application of these techniques using Python and relevant libraries like `pandas`, `sklearn`, and `matplotlib`.

## Exercises Description

### Exercise 1: Logistic Regression
- Focus: Logistic Regression models for diabetes prediction.
- Libraries: `pandas`, `sklearn.linear_model`, `sklearn.model_selection`, `sklearn.metrics`, `matplotlib`.
- Key Concepts: Data loading, model creation, training, prediction, and accuracy assessment.

### Exercise 2: Instance-Based Learning
- Focus: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for wine type classification.
- Libraries: `pandas`, `sklearn.neighbors`, `math`, `sklearn.metrics`, `matplotlib`.
- Key Concepts: Data preprocessing, KNN model fitting, accuracy evaluation, feature importance analysis.

### Exercise 3: Random Forests
- Focus: Decision Trees and Random Forests for breast cancer diagnosis.
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn.tree`, `sklearn.ensemble`, `sklearn.metrics`.
- Key Concepts: Decision tree and Random Forest Classifier, model tuning, feature selection, visualization.

## Usage Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install necessary Python packages: `pandas`, `numpy`, `sklearn`, and `matplotlib`.
3. Each exercise is contained in its own Jupyter notebook.
4. Open the notebooks using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to run the code cells.
